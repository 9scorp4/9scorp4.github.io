My work operates as an interconnected system, integrating multiple knowledge domains to create innovative research methodologies. This systemic approach, inspired by Gregory Bateson's work, allows me to address complex social challenges through multiple perspectives.

## Knowledge Domains

### Anthropological Knowledge
- Social research methodologies
- Cultural analysis frameworks
- Qualitative data interpretation
- Ethnographic approaches

### Systems Thinking
- Bateson's levels of learning
- Pattern recognition
- Feedback loops in social systems
- Emergent properties analysis

### Technical Implementation
- Python-based analysis pipelines
- Natural language processing
- API development
- Data visualization

## Applications

My work bridges these domains to create practical applications in:
- **Municipal knowledge systems** - Understanding how institutional knowledge flows
- **Systemic racism research** - Identifying patterns across public consultations
- **Digital anthropology** - Developing new methods for qualitative research in digital spaces
