## Knowledge Domains

### Social Research Methodologies
- Qualitative data collection techniques
- Mixed-methods research design
- Cultural analysis frameworks
- Ethnographic approaches
- Interview and survey methodology

### Systems Thinking
- Bateson's levels of learning and cybernetic principles
- Pattern recognition across complex datasets
- Feedback loops and dynamic system modeling
- Emergent properties analysis
- Cross-domain pattern identification

### Technical Implementation
- Python-based data processing pipelines
- Natural language processing and computational linguistics
- Machine learning for qualitative data analysis
- RESTful API development
- Interactive data visualization techniques
- Multilingual and cross-cultural data processing

## Applications

This integrated approach creates practical applications in:

- **Municipal Knowledge Systems** - Analyzing institutional information flows and decision-making processes
- **Public Data Analysis** - Identifying patterns across consultation documents and public records
- **Digital Research Methods** - Developing new computational approaches for qualitative data analysis
- **Multilingual Content Analysis** - Processing and analyzing content across linguistic boundaries
- **Cross-cultural Data Science** - Implementing culturally-aware computational methods
