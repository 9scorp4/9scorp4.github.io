I'm a researcher specializing in the integration of computational methods in social science research, with expertise in developing data-driven research tools that combine systems approaches with advanced analysis techniques to explore complex social phenomena.

## Professional Background

My work integrates social research with technological innovation, creating methodologies that bridge qualitative insight with quantitative precision. I apply a systems thinking approach, inspired by Gregory Bateson's work, to analyze complex social dynamics through multiple interconnected perspectives.

## Research Focus

- Systems-based approaches to social data analysis
- Computational social science methodologies
- Machine learning applications in qualitative research
- Municipal knowledge systems and public data
- Multilingual and cross-cultural data processing

## Current Work

As a Master's candidate at the University of Montreal, I'm developing innovative research tools that:
- Automate document analysis for large-scale text corpora
- Process multilingual content with advanced NLP techniques
- Generate interactive visualizations for complex research findings
- Apply machine learning to identify patterns in qualitative data

## Professional Experience

I've contributed to research at:
- Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et sécurité au travail (IRSST)
- Centre des mémoires montréalaises
- Laboratory for Research in Intercultural Relations (LABRRI)

## Technical Skills

- **Programming**: Python (advanced), SQL, emerging R skills
- **Data Analysis**: Natural language processing, machine learning, PostgreSQL
- **API Development**: FastAPI, RESTful architecture, data pipelines
- **Research Technologies**: Document processing, visualization, multilingual analysis

## Scholarly Affiliations

- Student member of Intercultural Relations Research Laboratory (LABRRI)
- Member of Culture-Arts-Societies Research Centre (CELAT)

## Education

* M.Sc. at University of Montreal (ongoing)
* B.Sc. from University of Montreal, 2019
