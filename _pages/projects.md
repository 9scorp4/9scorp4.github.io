A comprehensive research project analyzing municipal public consultation data in Montreal, developed as part of my master's research to identify patterns in institutional knowledge.

**Key Features:**
- High-performance document processing pipeline
- Bilingual text analysis engine (French/English)
- Research-specific analysis modules
- Interactive visualization components

**Analysis Pipelines:**
1. **Lexical Analysis Module**
   - Term frequency calculations with adaptive weighting
   - TF-IDF vectorization for document comparison
   - Cross-corpus lexical mapping
   - Category-based comparative analysis

2. **Language Pattern Analysis**
   - Bilingual content detection algorithms
   - Code-switching identification
   - Linguistic variation mapping
   - Domain-specific terminology extraction

3. **Knowledge Structure Analysis**
   - Conceptual categorization framework
   - Cross-reference mapping system
   - Multi-dimensional classification
   - Pattern intersection visualization

4. **Topic Modeling System**
   - Multi-algorithm approach (LDA, NMF, LSA)
   - Topic coherence optimization
   - Cross-validation methodology
   - Interactive topic visualization

5. **Sentiment and Discourse Analysis**
   - Document sentiment calculation
   - Multi-aspect opinion mining
   - Contextual sentiment evaluation
   - Temporal sentiment tracking

**Technologies:**
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, spaCy)
- PostgreSQL with specialized indexes
- FastAPI for data access layer
- Interactive D3.js visualizations

## Technical Development Projects

### Multilingual Research API
*Private Development*
